# ASM-Matrix
Computing the number of paths between two nodes

This program written in Assembly x86 computes the number of paths between two nodes of a graph by multiplying the matrix associated with the graph in a function. The memory for the matrix is dynamically allocated, using the syscall mmap2. It also features a small explanation about the choice of the given parameters in order to make the system call.
